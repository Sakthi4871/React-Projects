                <h3>Care Tips for Peace Lily</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Light:</li>
                  <p>Place your Aloe Vera- Medium Plant in bright, indirect sunlight. A south or west-facing window with filtered sunlight is ideal. While it can tolerate some direct sunlight, be cautious as too much can lead to sunburned leaves. Adequate sunlight is essential for the plant's growth and health.</p>
                  <li>Temperature:</li>
                  <p>Maintain a temperature range between 59-77°F (15-25°C). Protect your plant from cold drafts and sudden temperature fluctuations.</p>
                  <li>Pot and Soil:</li>
                  <p>Use a well-draining cactus or succulent potting mix. It should provide good aeration and prevent water from accumulating around the roots. Choose a pot with drainage holes to ensure excess water can escape.</p>
                  <li>Watering:</li>
                  <p>Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Aloe Vera Medium Plants are drought-tolerant. Water sparingly, approximately every 3-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Reduce watering significantly in the dormant season (fall and winter) to prevent overhydration. Always empty the saucer under the pot after watering to prevent the plant from sitting in standing water.</p>
                  <li>Container Size:</li>
                  <p>Aloe Vera -Medium Plants prefer slightly cramped conditions. Repot only when the plant has outgrown its current container.</p>
                  <li> Fertilization:</li>
                  <p>These plants are not heavy feeders. Fertilize sparingly with a balanced, diluted fertilizer every 2-3 months during the growing season. Avoid over-fertilization, as it can harm the plant.</p>
                  <li>Pruning:</li>
                  <p>Trim dead or damaged leaves at the base using clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears. This not only enhances the plant's appearance but also encourages new growth.</p>
                  <li>Pest Control:</li>
                  <p>Aloe Vera- Medium Plants are typically resistant to pests, but monitor for mealybugs or aphids. Treat any infestations promptly with insecticidal soap.</p>
                  <li>Rotation:</li>
                  <p>Rotate the plant occasionally to ensure even growth and prevent it from leaning toward the light source.</p>
                  <li>Dormant Season Care:</li>
                  <p>During the dormant season (fall and winter), reduce watering and avoid fertilization. The plant's growth naturally slows down during this time.</p>
                  <li> Propagation:</li>
                  <p>If you wish to propagate new Aloe Vera plants, you can do so by removing and rooting offsets (baby plants) that grow at the base of the main plant.</p>
